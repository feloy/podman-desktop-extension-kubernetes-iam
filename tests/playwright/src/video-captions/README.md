# E2E video captions

This directory turns a Playwright e2e run into a paced, captioned recording.
It is designed to make the recorded video explain itself without adding video-
specific helpers around every UI action. Captioning and pacing are disabled for
normal e2e runs.

## Components

- `runtime.ts` configures a test's caption pacing and exports `recordedStep`.
- `slow-typing.ts` transparently replaces `Locator.fill()` with sequential
  typing over a fixed duration.
- `reporter.ts` produces an ASS subtitle track and FFmetadata chapters.

## Enable the framework

Configure the reporter when a recording is requested:

```ts
if (process.env.VIDEO_SUBTITLES === 'true') {
  reporter.push([
    './src/video-captions/reporter.ts',
    {
      outputFile: './recordings/e2e.ass',
      chapterFile: './recordings/e2e.ffmetadata',
    },
  ]);
}
```

Install the runtime once from the shared Playwright fixture hook:

```ts
test.beforeEach(({ page }, testInfo) => {
  configureVideoCaptions(page, testInfo);
});
```

The recording script must export these variables for the test process:

| Variable                     | Purpose                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `VIDEO_SUBTITLES=true`       | Enables the reporter.                                                                                  |
| `CAPTION_PACE_MS`            | Pause after each emitted caption. Set to `0` for no pacing.                                            |
| `CAPTION_TYPING_DURATION_MS` | Total duration for each non-empty `.fill()` call. Set to `0` for normal fills.                         |
| `VIDEO_RECORDING_STARTED_AT` | Epoch milliseconds captured immediately before recording begins, used to align subtitles and chapters. |

## Write a recorded step

`recordedStep` marks one meaningful, reviewer-facing business outcome. Put the
UI actions that produce that outcome and the checks that verify it in the same
block. Do not use it for setup, navigation, cleanup, or a single click.

Import the helpers from the caption framework:

```ts
import { expect, frameForCaption, recordedStep } from './video-captions/runtime';
```

The recommended form has one named, final expectation. Its message says what
is already visible on screen after the action succeeds:

```ts
await recordedStep('Create the administrator user', async () => {
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create user' }).click();
  await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'User name' }).fill('admin');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create', exact: true }).click();
  await expect(
    page.getByRole('button', { name: 'admin', exact: true }),
    'The newly created administrator user is listed',
  ).toBeVisible();
});
```

The example produces yellow captions for the button click and text entry, then
a green caption—“The newly created administrator user is listed”—once the final
assertion passes. Each caption remains visible for `CAPTION_PACE_MS`.

When the final assertion's target may be off-screen, call
`frameForCaption(locator)` immediately before it. During paced recordings this
centers the element and checks that it is in the viewport; normal runs are
unchanged. For a disappearance assertion, frame a nearby surviving element.

## Caption rules

| Code                                                                     | Caption                                 | Colour | Timing                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `.click()`, `.check()`, `.uncheck()`, or `.fill()` inside `recordedStep` | The action and accessible control label | Yellow | After the interaction       |
| `expect(value, 'message')` inside `recordedStep`                         | The custom expectation message          | Green  | After the assertion passes  |
| `recordedStep('business outcome', ...)` with no named expectation        | The business-outcome text               | Green  | After the callback succeeds |
| Any action or expectation outside `recordedStep`                         | None                                    | —      | No caption or added delay   |

For a named expectation to produce a caption, import `expect` from
`./video-captions/runtime`, not from the underlying Playwright fixture package.
Unnamed expectations are still normal checks, but do not create a caption.
Always await a named expectation so its caption finishes before the next action
or test starts. For synchronous matchers such as `toMatchObject`, use
`await Promise.resolve(expect(value, 'message').toMatchObject(expected))` because
Playwright types the matcher as returning `void` while the caption wrapper
returns a promise.

### More than one named expectation

Every named expectation inside a `recordedStep` produces its own green caption
and its own pacing delay, in the order in which the expectations pass. The
business-step fallback caption is not added when at least one named expectation
is present.

Use multiple named expectations only when each one verifies a distinct state a
reviewer should have time to inspect. Usually, keep intermediate checks
unnamed and give only the final, durable result a message. This keeps the video
concise and ensures the final caption describes the state that remains on
screen.

```ts
await recordedStep('Create the administrator user', async () => {
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create user' }).click();
  await expect(dialog).toBeVisible(); // Check only: no caption.
  // …complete the dialog…
  await expect(userRow, 'The newly created administrator user is listed').toBeVisible();
});
```

## Chapters

The reporter creates one chapter for every executed test and uppercase,
Markdown-style chapter markers for each enclosing `test.describe` group. MP4
chapters are flat, so group markers are offset by one millisecond per nesting
level before the first child; this avoids FFmpeg collapsing same-timestamp
parent markers into zero-duration chapters.
